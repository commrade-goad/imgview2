# IMGVIEW 2

a second iteration of [imgview](https://github.com/commrade-goad/imgview)
that written in CPP to decrease the amount of `SEGFAULT` imgview has and lazy loading the next image.

## Feature that different from imgview 1.0

- No more segfault! ðŸ˜€
    * The amount of if NULL is unbelivable on the first imgview (yes i have a really big skill issue there)
- Lazy loading (max 5 threads) ðŸ’…
    * Will lazy load the image with max 5 threads so no more slow startup!
- Less image support for now ðŸ˜”
    * Since this version used `stb_image` it will support less image format for now... (will upgrade in the future!)
- No command mode for now ðŸ˜”
    * I dont use it at all.
